## Doomscrolling 

Doomscrolling is the act of "nonstop scrolling" bad news that usually leads to anxiety. I've been working on a Doomscrolling aggregator, to make it easier for people to scroll all day, when I'm not working.

## For now

You'll just have to enjoy this for now:

See what some top headlines of the last 2 years were get's pretty addicting: https://endlessdoomscroller.com/

My aggregator will be coming out in November 2022. Perfect timing. 

Cheers to another great night in 2022.
