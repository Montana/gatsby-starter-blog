## Doomscrolling 

_Doomscrolling_ is the act of "nonstop scrolling" bad news/headlines that usually leads to anxiety. I've been working on a Doomscrolling aggregator to make it easier for people to scroll _ALL_ the bad news, all day. This is a side project I work on when I'm not working. The hope is maybe the person in question will scroll themselves out.

## For now

You'll just have to enjoy this for now:

See what some of top headlines of the last 2 years were, it get's pretty addicting: https://endlessdoomscroller.com/ My aggregator will be coming out in **November 2022**. Perfect timing. 

Cheers to another great night in 2022.
